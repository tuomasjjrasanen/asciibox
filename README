Installation
============

There are multiple different ways to install asciibox,

The traditional way
-------------------

The traditional way makes an system-wide installation. If you choose go this
route, you need to ensure all dependencies are available too.

  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install

Using virtualenv and pip
------------------------

With virtualenv and pip, you can install asciibox and all its dependencies to an
isolated Python environment. This is especially useful if you cannot or do not
want to make an system-wide installation. It is also useful, if your system does
not have all dependencies available.

  virtualenv env
  source env/bin/activate
  python setup.py sdist
  pip install dist/asciibox-0.3.1.tar.gz

Using virtualenv and pip, install from PyPi
-------------------------------------------

You can also install asciibox from PyPi:

  virtualenv env
  source env/bin/activate
  pip install asciibox==0.3.1


Command line usage
==================

To render a text file as a PNG file, run:

  asciibox -i doc/examples/fig.txt -o fig.png

To render a text file as a SVG file, run:

  asciibox -i doc/examples/fig.txt -o fig.svg

Use --help to display all available options.


reStructuredText markup extension
=================================

The package contains also a reStructuredText extension which can be registered
with reStructuredText as follows:

  import asciibox
  asciibox.register_rst_directive()

Then the registered directive can be used to render an image with following
markup:

  .. asciibox:: fig1.png

     +----+
     |    |
     |    +<--
     |    |
     +----+
